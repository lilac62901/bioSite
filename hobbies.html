        <p>For this assignment I did a lot of different research on my subject Alan Chevsky. I started with an interview to get an idea of his life’s history. I then researched his goals on the internet to get a better understanding of my subject. Also, I spoke to him about his hobbies and researched these aspects of his character through the internet. Most of my information on my subject comes from long conversations about his life and dreams.</p>
        <p>For my interview I started by compiling a list of questions I thought I would need to gain an understanding of my subject Alan. Some of my questions were about his life’s history and some were about goals and aspirations. I tried to ask a variety of questions to produce an overview of Alan as a person. His answers provided a tremendous amount of information for me to choose from for this assignment.</p>
        <p>Some of my subject’s hobbies include following the news and current events, studying culture, watching the Cubs, studying Geography, listening to and playing music and reading. I researched some of his hobbies by visiting his favorite websites for news and current events. Also, I watched some of the Cubs game with him to gain some insight into that hobby. I enjoy a game more in person, but he will watch a game from anywhere.</p>
        <p>Alan has some very lofty and abstract goals in his life. He would like to do something to contribute to society but doesn’t know of any concrete ways to do so. He is still formulating a plan to achieve this goal. Alan would also like to visit every continent. All his goals are very fascinating to me, so I did some reading about ways to contribute to society and about travel.</p>
        <p>Overall this was a very interesting assignment. It helped me to learn a lot about my subject and his interests. A combination of conversations and research on the internet was a great way to go about studying a person for a bio project.</p>
