        <h3>about me</h3>
        <p>I was born in Odessa Ukraine and immigrated to the United States when I was four along with both of my parents. At first, we stayed with my Grandparents until we were able to get our own place in the city.</p>
        <p>My childhood was actually pretty good. Pretty normal, if there is such a thing. I went to a lot of museums, amusement parks, sporting events, summer camps. Sundown was our beta version of an alarm clock for curfew. While I assimilated quickly to the cultural and lingual differences at school, at home we still spoke Russian and my parents had mostly Russian/Ukrainian friends. I think this helped create my curiosity around other cultures and the desire to learn about them.</p>
        <p>I had multiple jobs throughout high school. I tried playing sports, but it wasn’t for me. I did participate in the model UN and Theater. Music was a passion of mine from an early age, so I listened to a lot of music, and I also learned how to play the guitar and piano.</p>
        <p>I went to Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, IL. After school I moved to Chicago with my now wife where I worked in the Travel Industry, and she worked in Graphic Design. We were only there for a few years before we decided to quit our jobs, sell everything we owned and move to Japan. After Japan we moved back to Chicago and lived there for over a decade. While living there I experienced my childhood love, the Cubs, win the World Series.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include following the news and current events, studying culture, and the Cubs. Also, I love studying Geography. I consider myself a budding futurist. And the Cubs. Music is also a passion of mine. Did I mention the Cubs?</p>
        <p>My goal is to do something to benefit society in whatever capacity that could be achieved. Another goal is to invent a new form of art never before seen or heard of. Finally, I would love to live a happy life with my happy wife.</p>
        <p>I currently live in Central Illinois with my wife and am looking for a career with meaning. And I am also looking for the path to my best possible life!</p>
